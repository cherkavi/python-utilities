  def __enter__(self)
  def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback)


In your example above, you'd use

class Package:
    def __init__(self):
        self.files = []

    def __enter__(self):
        return self

    # ...

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        for file in self.files:
            os.unlink(file)
Then, when someone wanted to use your class, they'd do the following:




with Package() as package_obj:
    # use package_obj
